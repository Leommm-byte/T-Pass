Password Manager (T-Pass)

A local password manager that is secure (in as much your system is).

Features:
- Save a website's name, email you used to sign up, and password.
- Generate a very secure password.
- Saves the details (website's name, email you used to sign up, and password) to a location on your computer i.e it saves them locally.
- Search through already saved details in other to retrieve the details quickly. This will save you from the hassle of searching all saved details manually.
- A quick feature: Once you generate a password, it is automatically copied to clipboard.

Requirements to use (on Windows):
- python installed (preferrably python 3.9 or greater)
- Any python IDE installed
- tkinter installed: run this command in terminal (without the quotes) - 'pip install tk'
